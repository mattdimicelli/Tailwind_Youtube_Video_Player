# Youtube Clone

## Overview

The goal of this project was to clone a Youtube page, making sure that the media
elements show up.  [This](https://mattdimicelli.github.io/youtube_video_player/) 
was the original page to clone, for reference and comparison.

## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Semantic HTML
- Material Design Icons via Google's Font Service

### What I learned

- The main learning points were HTML's built-in capabilities to work with media
such as images and videos, as well as about `<iframe>`, which is what was used 
in this webpage.
